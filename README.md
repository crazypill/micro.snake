# micro.snake

This is the classic snake game written for a Adafruit Feather M4 Express (it should run fine on M0 and Pro Trinket but you will have to adapt the high score code to talk to the right flash memory).

You will need the following from Adafruit:
1 x Adafruit Feather M4 Express - Featuring ATSAMD51 (ATSAMD51 Cortex M4) [ID:3857]
1 x Adafruit Mini Color TFT with Joystick FeatherWing                     [ID:3321] 
1 x Lithium Ion Polymer Battery - 3.7v 500mAh                             [ID:1578]
